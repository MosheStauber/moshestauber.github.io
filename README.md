1- Create a basic web UI for a user to enter a city name (e.g. New York City) and a temperature in F. 
2- Create in Solidity a smart contract which stores city name and temperature (as entered in 1-) and commits transaction on testnet chain. 
3- [optional, can be manual input/trigger] After a short duration (1-5min) a time trigger function would connect to weather.com and get the current temperature for the given city. 
4- Code then generates a transaction in the ETH protocol, finds the smart contract. 
5- Code compares the live temperature with the stored temperature. 
6- Returns in the web UI compared temperatures, flagging lower or higher temperature vs initially entered. 
[basic cryptoexplorer functionality is a plus]
